What is React and Why React ??

At first React is a library not a Framework.

React is a javscript library used for creating user interfaces.We use react in web development,mobile app development and desktop app development.
Facebook created React.js in 2011 for their own use. As you know, Facebook is one of the biggest Social Networking websites in the world today.

In 2012, Instagram also started using it, which is a subsidiary of Facebook.

In 2013, Facebook made React.js open-sourced. Initially, the developer community rejected it because it used Markup and JavaScript in a single file. But as more people experimented with it, they started embracing the component-centric approach for separating concerns.

In 2014, many large companies started using React.js in their production environments.

In 2015, Facebook open-sourced React Native too. It is a library that allows us to create native mobile apps in Android and iOS using React.js.

In 2016, with version 15, React.js started using Semantic Versioning. This also helped convey to the developer's community that React was more stable.

Today, React.js is used by many Fortune 500 companies. Facebook has full-time React development staff. They regularly release bug fixes, enhancements, blog posts, and documentation.

React CDN :-
ReactJs CDN is a popular CDN available on React Ecosystem, which allows you to get all the features of ReactJs in your project, especially when you are a beginner. There are many values that ReactJs CDN adds to your work: You get to use as little ReactJS as possible without setting up the boilerplate.

Cross orgin:-
Crossorigin attribute helps developers optimize the rates of CDN performance, at the same time, protecting the website code from malicious scripts. In particular, Crossorigin downloads the program code of the site in anonymous mode, without downloading cookies or performing the authentication procedure.

React root:-
The root element is the root element of the React DOM tree. It's the element passed to the rendering function ReactDOM.render where you will render your app or component.

React DOM:-
ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page. ReactDOM provides the developers with an API containing the various methods to manipulate DOM. 

async and defer in js:-
The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built.

The async attribute is somewhat like defer. It also makes the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.
In other words, async scripts load in the background and run when ready. The DOM and other scripts don’t wait for them, and they don’t wait for anything. A fully independent script that runs when loaded. As simple, as it can get, right?
